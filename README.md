# STAT-4205
(CU) STAT 4205 Linear Regression Models

The STAT GU4205 Project is an open ended case study intended to be a capstone on the Linear Regression Models course.

Because Medicare as well as most private insurance companies employ a fee-for-service model, a concerning trend in healthcare over the last two decades has been the declining compensation of primary care physicians (i.e. internal medicine, family medicine, pediatric, and geriatric physicians) who provide fewer discrete services and more comprehensive, preventative care compared to specialists.

In this report, we seek to examine public Medicare Part B physician payment data to evaluate whether primary care physicians receive less compensation than physicians of other medical specialties. In particular, we will assess the limited utility of the public Medicare Part B physician payment data set (in terms of linear regression analysis) in answering this research question.
